# A DEEP LEARNING SYSTEM FOR DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF SKIN DISEASES 

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of an advanced AI-powered diagnostic
tool aimed at accurately identifying various skin diseases. Utilizing state-of-the-art deep
learning architectures—DenseNet121, SE-ResNeXt101, and EfficientNetB0—the project
targets the challenges of dermatological diagnosis, especially in underserved areas with
limited access to specialists. The model's design leverages a diverse dermoscopic dataset
from the ISIC Archive, enabling the system to learn from a wide range of conditions,
including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis.

Methodologically, the project includes rigorous data preparation, model customization, and a layered training strategy. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC provide comprehensive insights into the models' diagnostic capabilities. The best performing model, DenseNet121, was integrated into a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing healthcare providers to receive real-time, image-based diagnostic support.
